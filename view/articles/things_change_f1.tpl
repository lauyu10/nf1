				<h1 class="title-page-article">5 things that F1 should change</h1>
				<p class="card-text">
					Before I give my point of view, I have to precise that these 5 reasons come from me, and it is just my opinion. You can be agreed with me or disagreed. </br>
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					-	Scoring system </br>
					Now it is the top 10 who score points 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1. In history, the f1 scoring systems were more restricted. </br>
					Because between 1960 and 2002, top 6 drives got points. The problem is for drivers who are out of the top 10. I believe that each place is important. </br>
					Each place needs to be rewarded. We have done a test with this scoring system: 1st gets 20 pts, 2nd gets 19 pts, etc…, 20th gets 1pt. </br>
					It is very interesting to see that the 2 driver standings are different. But, both are agreed on the champion of this year. It’s Lewis Hamilton. </br>
					The podium changes, with Bottas who is more accurate than Vettel (less DNF). He is 2nd and Vettel 3rd. At 4th and 5th, they are no changes, Raïkkönen and Ricciardo in this order. </br>
					Then, we have the 2 drivers from Force India Pérez and Ocon who are behind Verstappen. </br>
					With this system, we will have more battles in order to get some points very important in the driver standings but also in the constructor standings. </br>
					<img src="./view/images/f1_nascar_points.png" alt="Differents scoring system. On the left, the fantasy scoring system. On the right, the real scoring system in f1."/>
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					-	Races on public channels </br>
					If you want to be a sport that everyone knows. You need to be broadcasted on public channels. Yes of course, if you do this, FIA will receive less money from the tv rights. </br>
					Cause, at the moment, most public channels do not have enough money to fight against pay TV. But if you do this, there will be more people who can watch races. </br>
					It can also attract sponsors for F1, potentially more money than expected with pay TV. The merchandising can also have a boost with new fans. In fact, this year, </br>
					F1 puts some highlights on its youtube channel. </br>
					But is that enough?
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					-	Lees differences between big teams and small teams. </br>
					Now, you can see that big teams like Mercedes, Red Bull or Ferrari have a consequent budget. According to Sportune, Mercedes has 470 million €. Ferrari 450 million €, and Red Bull 430 million €. </br>
					Whereas on the other hand, we have Sauber Ferrari with 90 million €, Force India and Haas have 100 million €. The problem is that, because of this gap of budget, there are more differences in race. </br>
					Liberty Media owner of F1, wants some change about budget. They want a fixed budget. However, Ferrari wants to quit F1 because of that proposal.
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					-	Reintroduce refuelling </br>
					Reintroducing fuelling can give more choices. Therefore, we can see more risky strategies from the drivers and from the teams. That means MORE FUN.
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					-	Ban Virtual Safety Car
					Virtual safety car was introduced in F1 in 2015 at the Monaco Grand prix. But this system “keeps” the intervals between drivers. But, if you want more uncertain races. </br>
					You should introduce a safety car not a virtual safety race, after a big crash.
